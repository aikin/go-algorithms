## Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

> Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.



Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2]
Explanation:Â Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```
